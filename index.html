    <h1>About</h1>
    <p> To understand and define who I am, you have to accept that I create, innovate, and research in all capacities. My passion for creative works has taken me from a young athlete, to diving into the digital world as both an application developer, and an UX/UI designer. If you look at my <a href="current-projects">current projects</a> page you can see some of my ideas that are currently being implemented. You can also check out my design porfolio <a href="#portfolio">here</a>. I try to surround myself with some of the very best in their respected fields of business, art, fashion, and media.</p>
            <p>When I first graduated college, I built homes for those in my community. I saw this a the most helpful yet artistic way to give back to my community while I continued my journey as a designer/developer.</p>

    <h1 class="title1">Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Below are two original user flows and frame designs that were created by me. I have taken a slightly different approach to my portfolio by creating mock-ups of applications from a business perspective. Designing from this angle yields both great UX/UI and viable use cases. </p>

  <h3>üéì Education:</h3>
  <p>My college career was unique, having attended 4 different universities within 4 years. These transitions came as a result of me pursuing an opportunity to play professional baseball.
    I started out at West Virginia University, as a Mountaineer, studying Business Administration. Year 2 took me to Georgia Highlands College in Cartersville, GA. Transferring to community college was a necessity in order to stay compliant with NCAA rules. Even with the NCAA stipulation, my year at GHC served well for my personal development. Junior year I attended Mercer University in Macon, GA. While there, I studied Entrepreneurship at the Stetson School of Business.
    My 4th year/final stop for Senior year was at Keiser University in West Palm Beach, FL. Keiser is where I graduated with a degree in both Marketing and Business Management on October 25th, 2020.</p>
    <h3>üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª Work:</h3> <p>I supplied original UX/UI and graphic elements for "Xsauced". All of the screens I created were for the mobile application necessary for our business model.
    During my last semester of college, I attended Wyncode Academy in the Wynwood District in Miami. This opened my eyes to the world of coding, digital design, and the impact of the internet on businesses. I graduated from their Full-Stack Web Development Program and will be forever grateful for what I have learned under their guidance.
    Since then, I have been building my knowledge of both application development and design in hopes that I can be of service to businesses and individuals who are in need of innovation, rebranding, websites/apps, and of course UX/UI designs for mobile applications.
